## Time Complexity

## Number counting

Problem: You are given an integer m (1 ¬ m ¬ 1 000 000) and two non-empty, zero-indexed arrays A and B of n integers, a0, a1, . . . , an?1 and b0, b1, . . . , bn?1 respectively (0 ¬ ai , bi ¬ m). The goal is to check whether there is a swap operation which can be performed on these arrays in such a way that the sum of elements in array A equals the sum of elements in array B after the swap. By swap operation we mean picking one element from array A and one element from array B and exchanging them
